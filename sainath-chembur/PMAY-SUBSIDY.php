I am Single, can I still benefit from PMAY?</span>

<span class="d-block  color-primary text-capitalize">
Am I eligible for PMAY if I have a house in my native place or village?</span>

<p>If the roof of your village house is not made of concrete, it is not considered a 'pucca' house, but you will still qualify for the housing subsidy.</p>

How can I apply for PMAY?</span>

<ul>
<li>STEP 1: First you book a flat and apply for a housing loan</li>
<li>STEP 2: Bank sanctions your loan</li>
<li>STEP 3: Registration of the agreement</li>
<li>STEP 4: Your housing finance company / bank submits the claim of the subsidy to National Housing Bank</li>
<li>STEP 5: National Housing Bank transfers the amount to your bank</li>
<li>STEP 6: Bank deposits the subsidy to your loan account</li>
<li>STEP 7: Loan reduces to the extent of the subsidy received and the reduced EMI is set</li>
</ul> 
</p>
